# TDIA CNN

TDIA CNN is a university project developed as part of the AI course at Gamagora. This project simulates the behavior of a Formula 1 car learning to drive on a predefined racing track using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other artificial intelligence techniques.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zouiqad/td_ia_cnn.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have Unity version `2021.3.40f1` or later installed.
3. Open the project in Unity.

## Usage

Once the project is opened in Unity:

1. Open the `Scenes` folder and load the main scene.
2. Press the `Play` button in the Unity editor to run the simulation.
3. Adjust CNN parameters in the Inspector to see how different settings affect the car's learning behavior.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network Simulation**: Implements a CNN to simulate a Formula 1 car learning to navigate a track.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust various parameters to change the learning behavior and performance of the car.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Observe how the car learns and adapts in real-time to changes in its environment.
